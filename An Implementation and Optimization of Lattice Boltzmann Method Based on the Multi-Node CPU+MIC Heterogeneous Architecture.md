Tang, Peng, et al. "An Implementation and Optimization of Lattice Boltzmann Method Based on the Multi-Node CPU+MIC Heterogeneous Architecture." International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery IEEE, 2017:315-320.\
\
This article proposes a hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallel model of LBM based on CPU+MIC heterogeneous architecture, using D2Q9 model for data division and offload. Furthermore, they try to use various methods (including two-dimensional partitioning) to optimize the algorithm. Their optimization achieved better performance than the original model on the multi-node CPU+MIC heterogeneous architecture (the cluster of Shanghai University).

## 3.1 Scalability
Wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability. \
Scalability is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. For example, a system is considered scalable if it is capable of increasing its total output under an increased load when resources (typically hardware) are added.
